various ZSH completion scripts. these must be located in a $fpath
directory. for example in ~/.zshrc set

    fpath[0,1]=(~/.zsh/functions/darwin ~/.zsh/functions)
    autoload -U compinit && compinit

and then place whatever completions are necessary into ~/.zsh/functions
(or the OS-specific dir) and then restart any open shells
